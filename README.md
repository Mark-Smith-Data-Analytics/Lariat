# Lariat
This project involved a fictional car rental agency, Lariat Car Rental Agency.  I was given several spreadsheets of data in Microsoft Excel, and tasked
with creating a streamlined, user-friendly dashboard to display pertinent data about certain vehicles in the fleet.  It included charts that automatically updated.  I also created a PowerPoint presentation in which I made suggestions to increase profitability for Lariat Car Rental Agency.
